                <p align="center">Despite my love for my games, I'm quite unexperienced when it comes to anything related to development.
                However, I love the designing aspect of games and I'm persevering to take a career that revolves around that.
                In addition to that, I also love ideation and being a platform for other people to voice out their own ideas.
                Overall, I see myself as someone who proficient at conceptualizing and someone who can be quite accomodating when it comes to achieving my own goals.</p>
